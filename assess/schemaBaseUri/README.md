# JSON Schema base URI bypassing tests

These tests assess whether references to the interior of a JSON Schema
document correctly take into account how `"$id"` in parent schema objects
changes the base URI for `"$ref"`.

The outcome directories hold a `resolved.yaml` file that shows the possible,
expected, and processed (actual) base URIs and the resulting resolved reference
URIs, and indicates whether the resolution is valid according to the JSON
Schema specificaiton or not.  These files conform to the following JSON Schema:

```YAML

                The possible base URIs according to each source documented in
                a subsection of RFC 3986 ยง5.1; the lowest-numbered subsection
                with a non-`null` value is the correct base URI.  Note that
                the application-level default base URI field is included for
                completeness only, and is not relevant to these cases.
